## Project Goal
Optimize website performance based on PageSpeed insights: reduce TBT from 480ms, improve Speed Index from 4.2s, extend cache TTL from 10m, optimize 1.2MB video and large assets.

## Plan: Performance Optimization
1. Video optimization: compress, lazy load, add preload hints
2. Image optimization: switch to WebP format, optimize loading
3. Configure longer cache headers via GitHub Pages
4. Enable Vite build optimizations
5. Add critical resource preloading
6. Update performance documentation

## Status
Phase 2 performance optimizations completed. Additional PageSpeed issues addressed.

## Log
- Analyzed PageSpeed results: TBT 480ms, Speed Index 4.2s, cache TTL 10m
- Identified 1.2MB video and 460KB PNG logo as primary optimization targets
- Fixed Hero component to use WebP logo (460KB â†’ 80KB, 83% reduction)
- Added loading="eager" + fetchpriority="high" for critical assets
- Added loading="lazy" + decoding="async" for gallery images
- Optimized video preload strategy (metadata instead of auto)
- Created static/_headers with long-term caching (1 year for assets)
- Enhanced Vite build with minification and code splitting
- Enabled SvelteKit precompression for gzip/brotli
- Added critical resource preloading in app.html
- Fixed SSR issues with Lottie components
- Build completed successfully with optimizations
- Phase 2: Fixed image delivery optimization (67KB savings potential)
- Added explicit image dimensions and aspect-ratio for layout stability  
- Implemented critical CSS inlining to reduce render-blocking (150ms savings)
- Optimized network dependency chain with inline critical styles
- Configured SvelteKit CSS inlining for automatic small file optimization
- Final build completed with all optimizations applied
