## Project Goal
Optimize website performance based on latest PageSpeed insights: reduce image delivery size by 53 KiB, optimize critical request chain latency from 421ms, and reduce unused JavaScript by 72.6 KiB.

## Plan: Advanced Performance Optimization Phase 4
1. **Image Optimization**: Resize logo to proper display dimensions (319x500) to save 52.6 KiB
2. **JavaScript Optimization**: Split and defer unused JavaScript to reduce 72.6 KiB
3. **CSS Critical Path**: Further optimize critical CSS to reduce 660ms render-blocking
4. **Network Dependencies**: Optimize critical path chain to reduce latency from 421ms
5. **Documentation Update**: Update performance docs with latest optimizations

## Status
Phase 4 optimization completed. Achieved 36.5 KiB image savings and optimized critical path.

## Log
- Analyzed latest PageSpeed results: Image oversized (573x897 → 319x500), 72.6 KiB unused JS, 421ms critical path
- Logo optimization: 78KB → 41.5KB (46.8% reduction, 36.5 KiB saved)
- Enhanced JavaScript tree-shaking and chunk splitting for better caching
- Improved critical CSS with complete above-the-fold styles inlined
- Added comprehensive resource hints (preload, preconnect, modulepreload)
- Enhanced Vite configuration with aggressive minification and tree-shaking
- Added critical video/iframe container styles directly in HTML head
- Build completed successfully with all optimizations applied
- Final logo: Tzofen_logo2_optimized.webp (41.5KB, exact display dimensions 320x500)
