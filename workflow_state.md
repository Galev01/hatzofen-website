## Project Goal
Fix critical production JavaScript error: 'Cannot read properties of null (reading 'u')' occurring in the compiled Svelte application.

## Plan: Production Error Bug Fix
1. **Error Investigation**: Analyze the production error stack trace and identify potential causes
2. **Source Code Analysis**: Review components for null reference issues, especially dynamic imports
3. **Defensive Coding**: Implement null checks and fallback patterns for dynamic imports
4. **Browser API Safety**: Add defensive checks for browser-only APIs
5. **Testing & Documentation**: Build testing and comprehensive documentation

## Status
Production error bug fix completed successfully. All dynamic imports now have proper null checks and fallback UI.
