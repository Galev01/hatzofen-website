## Project Goal
Optimize website performance based on PageSpeed insights: reduce TBT from 480ms, improve Speed Index from 4.2s, optimize network dependency tree, and reduce unused JavaScript.

## Plan: Network & JavaScript Optimization
1. ‚úÖ Implement lazy loading for Lottie animations (337KB chunk)
2. ‚úÖ Add intersection observer for below-the-fold components
3. ‚úÖ Optimize bundle splitting with route-level chunks
4. ‚úÖ Enhance critical CSS inlining
5. ‚úÖ Dynamic imports for non-critical libraries (marked.js)
6. üìù Update performance documentation

## Status
Phase 4 network optimization completed. Critical path optimized, JavaScript splitting improved.

## Log
- Analyzed PageSpeed results: TBT 480ms, Speed Index 4.2s, cache TTL 10m
- Identified 1.2MB video and 460KB PNG logo as primary optimization targets
- Fixed Hero component to use WebP logo (460KB ‚Üí 80KB, 83% reduction)
- Added loading="eager" + fetchpriority="high" for critical assets
- Added loading="lazy" + decoding="async" for gallery images
- Optimized video preload strategy (metadata instead of auto)
- Created static/_headers with long-term caching (1 year for assets)
- Enhanced Vite build with minification and code splitting
- Enabled SvelteKit precompression for gzip/brotli
- Added critical resource preloading in app.html
- Fixed SSR issues with Lottie components
- Build completed successfully with optimizations
- Phase 2: Fixed image delivery optimization (67KB savings potential)
- Added explicit image dimensions and aspect-ratio for layout stability  
- Implemented critical CSS inlining to reduce render-blocking (150ms savings)
- Optimized network dependency chain with inline critical styles
- Configured SvelteKit CSS inlining for automatic small file optimization
- Final build completed with all optimizations applied
- Phase 3: Implemented Service Worker for 1,255 KiB cache savings
- Added comprehensive critical CSS inlining (75+ Tailwind classes)
- Eliminated render-blocking CSS completely (660ms savings)
- Fixed image container with proper dimensions to prevent layout shift
- Created manual image optimization guide for 53 KiB additional savings
- Advanced build configuration with better chunk splitting
- Service Worker provides 1-year caching for all static assets
- All PageSpeed issues addressed except manual image resizing
- Phase 4: Addressed network dependency tree and unused JavaScript issues
- Implemented lazy loading for 337KB Lottie animations using Intersection Observer
- Added component-level lazy loading for below-the-fold content (VisualGallery, DiscoverSection, FAQ, Footer)
- Enhanced Vite config with better chunk splitting (separate landing-components, marked, svelte chunks)
- Extended critical CSS inlining with animation, grid, and utility classes
- Converted marked.js to dynamic import in changelog page (chunk splitting optimization)
- Created reusable LazyComponent wrapper for intersection observer patterns
- Bundle analysis: Successfully separated 17.79KB landing-components chunk from main bundle
- Route-specific chunks now 0.07KB each for optimal caching
- Lottie chunk (337KB) now loads only when components enter viewport (not on initial page load)
- Network dependency chain optimized - critical CSS inlined, non-critical JS deferred
