# "הצופן" (The Cipher) Landing Page Overview

This document outlines the development approach, structure, and design considerations for the "הצופן" mobile app landing page.

## 1. Project Goal

The primary goal is to create a compelling, responsive, and Hebrew-first (RTL) landing page that effectively drives downloads for the "הצופן" app. The page will showcase the app's unique puzzle gameplay, rich content, and cultural value.

Refer to the main project brief for detailed requirements.

## 2. Target Audience

-   Primary: Native Hebrew speakers who enjoy word puzzles.
-   Secondary: Hebrew learners and those interested in Jewish/Hebrew culture.

## 3. Core Technical Stack

-   **HTML5**: For semantic structure.
-   **CSS3**: For styling, with a strong focus on modern layout techniques (Flexbox/Grid) and ensuring flawless RTL rendering.
-   **JavaScript**: Minimal, used for the dynamic copyright year and available for potential micro-interactions or future enhancements. The page aims to be lightweight and fast-loading.

## 4. Visual Design & Branding

The landing page will adhere to the app's established visual identity:

-   **Background**: Dark Blue/Grey (`#1A1F2C`)
-   **Primary Color**: Purple (`#9b87f5`)
-   **Accent Color**: Light Peach/Orange (`#FDE1D3`)
-   **Text Color (Light)**: Off-white/Light Grey (`#F0F0F0`)
-   **Typography**: Clear, readable Hebrew fonts suitable for a modern aesthetic. (Specific font to be determined; a system sans-serif like 'Arial' or 'Helvetica Neue' will be used as a fallback initially, with common Hebrew web fonts considered).
-   **Overall Style**: Modern, clean, polished, and intuitive.
-   **RTL**: The entire page is designed and implemented for optimal Right-to-Left display.

## 5. Landing Page Structure (Sections)

As outlined in the project brief and `workflow_state.md`, the page will include:

1.  **Hero Section**: Headline, sub-headline, app mockups, download buttons.
2.  **"מה זה הצופן?" / "איך משחקים?"**: Explanation of game mechanics.
3.  **"למה תאהבו את הצופן?" / Features Showcase**: Key app features with icons.
4.  **Visual Gallery / Screenshots**: Showcasing app UI/UX.
5.  **"גלו עולם של חוכמה וכיף"**: Broader benefits and cultural connection.
6.  **Footer**: Download buttons, legal links (Privacy Policy, Terms of Use).

## 6. Key Considerations

-   **Call to Action (CTA)**: Prominent and clear download buttons for App Store and Google Play.
-   **Content**: All copy will be in Hebrew, reflecting an engaging and intelligent tone.
-   **Responsiveness**: The layout will adapt seamlessly to desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
